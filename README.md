# proteomic_analysis
This repository are for to find out the novel drug targets and vaccine candidates in the pathogen proteome.
Subtractive proteomics involves several steps to identify potential drug targets and vaccine candidates. Here are the main steps typically included in a subtractive proteomics workflow:

1. **Data Retrieval and Compilation**
2. **Duplicate Protein Removal**
3. **Host-Pathogen Comparison**
4. **Identification of Unique Pathogen Proteins**
5. **Essentiality Assessment**
6. **Subcellular Localization Prediction**
7. **Metabolic Pathway Analysis**
8. **Drug Target Prediction**
9. **Vaccine Candidate Prediction**
