# proteomic_analysis for drug target identification
This repository are for to find out the novel drug targets in the pathogen proteome.
Subtractive proteomics involves several steps to identify potential drug targets and vaccine candidates. Here are the main steps typically included in a subtractive proteomics workflow:

1. Data Retrieval
2. Duplicates sequence elimination by CDHIT server
3. Non-homologs (BLASTp)
4. Vital protein by DEG database 
5. Metabolic Pathways analysis
6. Cellular Localization
7. Virulency analysis
8. Gut orthologs identification
9. Drugbank analysis (BLASTp)
